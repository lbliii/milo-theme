# Welcome to {{%prod%}} Theme

 {{%prod%}} is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme made for **documentation engineers** and **technical writers**, by one.

## Why use Hugo?

- **Affordable**: Technical Writers usually have a razor-thin budget; you can deploy docs with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (or [Render](https://render.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)) for free in most cases (Startup, Open Source)
- **Scalable**: Hugo is the fastest SSG, supports localization, is un-opinionated in terms of style, and is easy to evolve alongside your product
- **Ergonomic**: The drafting UX is markdown focused with near-instant local previews; for non-tehchnical contributors, you can plug into CMS interfaces (e.g., [Frontmatter](https://frontmatter.codes/))
- **Agnostic**: You'll always own your docs, and transforming content into [JSON](/index.json) or [XML](/index.xml) is as easy as defining an output template (great for search tools like Algolia!)
