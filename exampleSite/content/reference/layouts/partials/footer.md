For now, I've left the footer as a blank slate --- do with it what you wish!

## How it works

This partial is referenced from the [`baseof.html`](/reference/layouts/defaults/baseof) [**default**](/reference/layouts/defaults) layout.

## Source code 

{{%include "layouts/partials/footer.html" "golang" %}}
