## Before you start

- This section assumes that you have experience with terminals, CLIs, and IDEs (for example, VS Code)
- You should ideally have a git tool (for example, [GitHub](https://github.com)) to store and manage your site repo

## Why Hugo

- **Affordable**: Technical Writers typically have a razor-thin budget; deploy docs with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (or [Render](https://render.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)) for free in most cases (Startup, Open Source)
- **Scalable**: Hugo, the fastest SSG, supports localization, remains stylistically un-opinionated, and evolves alongside your product
- **Ergonomic**: The drafting UX focuses on markdown with near-instant local previews; for non-technical contributors, integrate with CMS interfaces (for example, [Frontmatter](https://frontmatter.codes/))
- **Agnostic**: Always own your docs, and transforming content into [JSON](/index.json) or [XML](/index.xml) remains straightforward by defining an output template (great for search tools like [Algolia](http://algolia.com)!)

## Why this theme

- **No Manual Menus**: All sections auto sort based on either a `weight` value or `a-z` title order
- **Deep Section Nesting**: Technical documentation often requires deep section nesting
- **Discovery UX Components**: Algolia Search & ChatGPT UIs come out-of-the-box for easy hookup
- **Battle Tested Shortcodes**: These shortcodes have evolved over the years based on real-world documentation needs for all kinds of software products
- **TailwindCSS + VanillaJS**: You'll can configure this theme to your liking using the basics with minimal dependencies
- **Brand-able**: Colors and fonts have their own CSS files; the TailwindCSS extensions mapped to these styles use generic names like `font-brand`, `font-semibold`, and `brand-color-1`.
