After you have locally installed Hugo and deployed a copy of this theme, you can start configuring your site. This guide will walk you through the basics of configuring your site, including setting the site URL and metadata.

## Site URL

The site URL is the base URL for your site. This is the URL that will be used to generate links to your site. You can set the site URL in the `config/_default/config.yaml` file. 

```yaml
baseURL: "https://example.com"
```
